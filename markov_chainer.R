# testing_corpus <- "A Markov process is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property[1] (sometimes characterized as memorylessness). In simpler terms, a Markov process is a process for which one can make predictions for its future based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's 
# full history.[11] In other words, conditional on the present state of the system, its future and past states 
# are independent. Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either a discrete state space or a discrete 
# index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies.[12] For example, it 
# is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable 
# state space (thus regardless of the nature of time),[13][14][15][16] but it is also common to define a Markov 
# chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space)."
